  <h3>Meet Beams, a better web framework</h3>

  <p class="postmetadata"><span class="postbyline">By The Roscoe Team</span> | <span class="postdateline"> April 28,2014</span> | <span class="posttags">Tags: Company News, Beams</span></p>
  <p>Today we're elated to publicly release Beams, a free framework for building content-focused, media-rich websites. This version is just an alpha, but we believe it contains the right seeds to become a powerful, full-fledged solution for publishers of all sizes over time.</p>
  <p>The chief features of Beams at this point are an ultraresponsive visual design, a server module, and an ad-display plugin to help support a key revenue stream for many sites. For a fuller intro, check out <a href="//roscoelabs.com/beams">the product page</a> we've now added for Beams.</p>
  <p>The framework is free to use under <a href="//opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a>, so you can begin building and innovating however you like today.</p>
  <p>Of course, one of our chief aims with this initial release is to build a <a href="//roscoelabs.com/community">community</a> around Beams to make it even better. There are a number of ways people can contribute, regardless of your level of technical skill.</p>
  <p>We'd encourage fellow developers to have a look at the Beams repos on <a href="//github.com/roscoelabs">our GitHub page</a>. We also accept monetary <a href="//roscoelabs.com/community/donate.html">donations</a> to defray our development costs, and we have a Beams Working Group <a href="//groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/beams-working-group">listserv</a> that anyone can join to discuss the project.</p>
  <p>In essence, Beams is the tool we wish we'd had at hand ourselves when we started out on earlier projects, especially our recently <a href="//roscoelabs.com/blog/20140425-rebooting-roscoe.html">deprecated</a> Roscoe.TV web app for local news video. Since we're news junkies at heart, first and foremost, we hope Beams will have a big impact on the legacy news industry. But we also believe other types of digital publishers, from personal blogs to entertainment sites to who knows what else, may find Beams useful as well.</p>
  <p>With the release of Beams, Roscoe Labs is effectively dedicating itself to a new mantra: "Open media. Open communities." We intend to follow that idea where it leads, as old reporters are wont to do.</p>
  <p>We hope you'll join us.</p>
