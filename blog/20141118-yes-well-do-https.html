  <h3>Yes, we'll do HTTPS.</h3>

  <p class="postmetadata"><span class="postbyline">By Peter McKay</span> | <span class="postdateline"> November 18,2014</span> | <span class="posttags">Tags: Company News, Beams, https</span></p>

  <p>On its developer blog last week, the New York Times came out as <a href="//open.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/embracing-https">an adamant proponent</a> of using the HTTPS protocol to serve news content on the Web. The post, co-authored by Times developer Eitan Konigsburg, Times CTO Rajiv Pant, and independent digital strategist Elena Kvochko, is definitely worth a read in full. But the jist is that it's increasingly important to protect readers from "man in the middle" eavesdropping on the Web. HTTPS can be a valuable tool to that end.</p>

  <p>The Times isn't the first to make such a case -- the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others have made <a href="//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/07/google-news-doesnt-index-https-sites-bad-policy-reader-privacy">similar arguments</a> in the past -- but it is of course a major milestone for a news provider of the NYT's size and stature to get on board. The strong implication is they'll soon implement HTTPS site-wide themselves, which would be a major win for the public.</p>

<p>Notably, the post also included a call to action for other publishers:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you run a news site, or any site at all, weâ€™d like to issue a friendly challenge to you. Make a commitment to have your site fully on HTTPS by the end of 2015 and pledge your support with the hashtag #https2015.</p></blockquote>

<p>Challenge accepted here! Frankly, we'd recently purchased a security certificate for roscoelabs.com and were in the process of migrating this site to HTTPS anyway.</p>

<p>More important, we're also planning to add full HTTPS integration to our Beams framework in 2015, to make it a better open-source tool for <em>other sites</em> that want to implement HTTPS as well.</p>

<p>I'd envision this iteration will entail three key steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Incorporate the Node.js <a href="//nodejs.org/api/https.html">HTTPS module</a> into Beams Server.</li>
  <li>Update the Beams Ads module as needed so it preserves or enhances sites' revenue generation. As the Times rightly points out, one big reason many publishers probably haven't migrated to HTTPS yet is that it would break their advertising functionality, which often relies on insecure third-party APIs. Beams Ads was always intended to return greater in-house control of ad functionality to publishers, so making it work with HTTPS is definitely consistent with that goal.</li>
  <li>Document everything thoroughly so that others can implement the Beams modules easily. Can't forget this part!</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll reiterate, Beams is free to use under MIT License, and always will be. If you're interested in contributing to the framework, please drop me a message <a href="//twitter.com/peteramckay">on Twitter</a>, contribute to the codebase on <a href="//github.com/roscoelabs">GitHub</a>, or join the <a href="//groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/beams-working-group">Beams Working Group</a> email list.</p>
