  <h2>Beams v0.1.2 is here.</h2>

  <p class="postmetadata"><span class="postbyline">By The Roscoe Team</span> | <span class="postdateline"> February 20, 2015</span> | <span class="posttags">Tags: Company News, Beams</span></p>
  <p>Today we're happy to announce the release of Beams v0.1.2, our free framework for building media websites. (Download it <a href="../beams-0.1.2.zip">here</a>.) This beta release contains key improvements in three broad areas -- responsiveness, speed, and testing.</p>
  <p>A summary of what's new:</p>
  <h4 class="margin-top">Responsiveness</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>An improved 20-column responsive grid</strong> that "stacks" containers more cleanly to fill the full width of each beam. This fixes a bug in which some of the containers would align "raggedly" at certain viewport widths. (A hat tip here to GitHub user Joel Courtney, who reported the issue as a bug.)</li>
    <li><strong>Use of the meta tag max-scale has been eliminated</strong> in the index.html file, to better support the needs of visually impaired users. Previously, this tag impaired zooming in on content for some users at certain viewport widths. (A hat tip to Dave Gamache and the community working on his CSS framework Skeleton, which recently had a great discussion on this topic. We're happy to follow their lead in eliminating max-scale.)</li>
    <li><strong>Added new CSS styles for classes named .sidebar and .mainbar</strong>, with related media queries, to better support common designer use cases in which a site has one major field for content positioned next to a complementary. For now, these classes are recommended primarily for use in pairs -- one main bar and one sidebar only within a beam. Also, one should not be used without the other. Primary benefit when the new classes are used is that they aid scaling for tablets and other mid-sized screens, so the sidebar doesn't become exceedingly narrow so as to be illegible.</li>
    <li><strong>Video players are now made responsive using custom jQuery scripts</strong> by Roscoe's own Peter McKay, included in the file beams-client.js. New scripts replace the third-party plugin FitVids.js, which is now eliminated from Beams. Responsive scaling of HTML5 players, YouTube embeds, and Vimeo embeds still supported, as in previous versions of Beams. Embedded video maintains consistent 16:9 aspect ratio.</li>
    <li><strong>CSS attribute object-fit is now added</strong> to video players and images to aid with scaling.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="margin-top">Speed</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Added statements using the Express framework's new "route" feature</strong> to the beams-server.js file, to improve server-side handling/performance of site assets.</li>
    <li><strong>CSS and client-side JavaScript files have been consolidated</strong> into a single file for each language, to limit the number of http requests and speed page loads. Consolidated files are named beams.css and beams-client.js. Latter file includes a minified copy of jQuery v2.1.3, which is an upgrade over v2.1.1 included in the last version of Beams.</li>
    <li><strong>New HTML5 prefetch tags have been added</strong> to the index.html file to speed interaction with three popular social sites that are particularly pertinent to Beams's target audience of media sites. Prefetches call DNS information for YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook when other site processes aren't running.</li>
  </ul>


  <h4 class="margin-top">Testing</h4>
     <ul class="margin-bottom">
       <li>Added new folder at site/tests, with pages to unit test the site's responsive grid and the scaling of video players. We may add additional tests for other framework features in subsequent releases, of course.</li>
     </ul>

  <p>In Beams v0.1.2, we've also removed or replaced several third-party scripts, except for a few snippets of code to help implementers' projects interact with a select handful of the very most popular APIs and communities around the Web, such as YouTube, Google Analytics, et cetera.</p>
  <p>Among the stuff removed are certain third-party scripts that were in the last few versions of Beams to aid with interstitial ad display and setting of cookies. Frankly, there wasn't a lot of interest in these for the projects we've been working on so far using Beams, which was a major reason for eliminating them from the public v0.1.2 release. (If any implementers really, really, really find you still want this functionality for your projects, no problem, though. The code is still available via Beams' <a href="//github.com/roscoelabs/beams/releases">release history on GitHub</a>.)</p>
  <p>If there's an overarching theme to this release, it's that Beams is becoming more focused as a product, which is definitely a healthy thing. That said, we still have a lot of iterating we want to do while in beta.</p>
  <p class="padded-bottom">As ever, we welcome contributions from the community to improve Beams, which is free to use under MIT license. The best ways to participate are via either <a href="//github.com/roscoelabs">GitHub</a> or the Beams Working Group <a href="//groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/beams-working-group">email list</a>, which is open to anyone who wants to contribute to the project, regardless of technical background.</p>
