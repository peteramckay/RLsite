  <h3>Rebooting Roscoe</h3>

  <p class="postmetadata"><span class="postbyline">By The Roscoe Team</span> | <span class="postdateline"> April 25,2014</span> | <span class="posttags">Tags: Company News, Roscoe.TV</span></p>


  <p>Since the earliest days of Roscoe Labs, we've been rethinking the way people create and consume digital media.</p>
  <p>Over the last few years, we have brainstormed. Argued. Refined our ideas. Tested our designs with real people. And we <a href="http://roscoeblog.wordpress.com/2013/08/07/new-york-and-san-fransco-meet-roscoe/" target="_blank">launched Roscoe.TV</a> in August 2013, our first public beta release to test our thinking.</p>
  <p>Today we're ending that experiment, and we're announcing plans to launch a new flagship product on Monday, April 28, 2014. Be sure to check our homepage at roscoelabs.com or our <a href="http://twitter.com/roscoe_labs" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RoscoeLabs" target="_blank">Facebook</a> accounts for the full update when the time comes.*</p>
  <p>Why the change? Well, to be frank, the user feedback we received on Roscoe.TV validated some of our early assumptions, especially the idea that people are hungry for new ways to consume digital news video and other media. Other market developments -- for instance, the recent over-the-top bullish remarks by <a href="http://a16z.com/2014/02/25/future-of-news-business/">uber-VC Marc Andreesen</a> about the future of news -- also reinforced the general idea that we're on the right track.</p>
  <p>All that said, traffic to Roscoe.TV never quite took off as we'd hoped. And in the meantime, we'd come up with other ideas that we found even more exciting as ways to push digital media forward. Thus it just made sense to shift our time, attention, and resources elsewhere.</p>
  <p>Our commitment to being industry leaders has not changed. To the contrary, we are emboldened and energized by the investment and renewed vigor in the digital media space of late.</p>
  <p>We look forward to pushing ahead with even bigger and better things, beginning with Monday's announcement. In the meantime, we want to thank everyone who worked on Roscoe.TV, especially everyone who participated in our user testing.</p>
<em><p>*PS: You might have noticed, we also have a new blog format here. This itself is an indicator of changes to come. We're now entirely self-hosted, and so we'll be phasing out the old <a href="http://roscoeblog.wordpress.com">WordPress.com blog</a> we were using to announce company news previously. The old posts will remain available, but we'll just cease to put new ones up there. New blog url that will be actively maintained is <a href="http://roscoelabs.com/blog">roscoelabs.com/blog</a></p></em>
