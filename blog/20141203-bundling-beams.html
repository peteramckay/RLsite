<h3>Bundling Beams</h3>

  <p class="postmetadata"><span class="postbyline">By The Roscoe Team</span> | <span class="postdateline"> Dec. 3, 2014</span> | <span class="posttags">Tags: Company News, Beams, Releases </span></p>


  <p>We're happy to announce that the v0.1.1 update of Beams, our open framework for building media websites, is now available for <a href="../beams-0.1.1.zip">download</a>. Major change in this version is that we've consolidated what were previously <a href="//roscoelabs.com/blog/20140428-meet-beams.html">three code libraries</a> into one, to make Beams more of a one-stop development tool.<p>
  <p>It sounds like a small thing, but we think it'll make a big difference in helping people use Beams to get their sites up and running quickly.</p>
  <p>As we were talking to friends over the last few months, especially folks at professional news organizations and a few profs teaching digital journalists, it became pretty apparent that a change like this would lower the barrier to adopting Beams for a lot of people.<p>
  <p>For v0.1.1, we've also wrapped in some tweaks to typography, ad display, and other stuff as well. For full nitty-gritty, we'd recommend that you just <a href="../beams-0.1.1.zip">download the framework</a>, check out the readme file, and start hacking. You can also check out full <a href="//github.com/roscoelabs/beams/releases">release notes</a> for v0.1.1 on GitHub, fork the repository there for your projects, make pull requests, etc.<p>
  <p>Of course, we should also reiterate here that Beams is free to use under MIT license, and we welcome ideas from anyone who wants to make the software better. The best way to participate is to join the <a href="//groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/beams-working-group">Beams Working Group</a> listserv.<p>
 <p>Notably, we're also moving from alpha to beta with the release of Beams 0.1.1. The timing just seemed right. The software is still in fairly early form, but the feature list is growing, and we think we have our work cut out for us looking ahead.</p>
