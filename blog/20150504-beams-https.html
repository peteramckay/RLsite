<h3>An HTTPS version of Beams</h3>

  <p class="postmetadata"><span class="postbyline">By Peter A. McKay</span> | <span class="postdateline"> May 4, 2015</span> | <span class="posttags">Tags: Company News, Beams, https</span></p>


<p>Today we release Beams v0.2.0, an update that we believe represents a major milestone for the framework. In this version, we've added support for HTTPS by default, to enhance privacy for users as they consume the news. </p>
<p>News sites of all sizes now have a fresh open-source tool to use as they play catch-up in the race for improved privacy. Unfortunately, as the New York TImes eloquently <a href="//open.blogs.nytimes.com//2014/11/13/embracing-https/">pointed out</a> on its developer blog last November, many news publishers still don't use HTTPS, which encrypts data while it's in transit to or from a user.</p>
<p>The Times also issued a friendly "HTTPS Challenge" to the news industry to adopt HTTPS by the end of 2015. We've now met that challenge ourselves, as we <a href="//roscoelabs.com/blog/20141118-yes-well-do-https.html">promised</a>, by converting roscoelabs.com to HTTPS. But more important, we believe we've gone a step above and beyond by expanding the toolkit for others to do the same.</p>
<p>Beams v0.2.0 is a direct outgrowth of the work we've done on our own site. We upgraded, and now we're sharing our our code and documentation of our method for other people to use as well.</p>
<p>To help with the move to HTTPS, we added the reverse-proxy server Nginx to Beams for the first time, integrating it with our existing Node.js script. This approach not only allows for smooth handling of security certificates, it also gives additional options for load balancing across multiple  user-facing content servers, if a project calls for it.</p>
<p>We've also added Apache Bench and MongoDB as requirements for v0.2.0, to enhance testing and database functionality.</p>
<p>You can download the source code for Beams v0.2.0 <a href="//roscoelabs.com/beams-0.2.0.zip" onClick=”_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'External Link', 'v0.2.0 download']);”>here</a>. We've also posted a handy "Getting Started" <a href="//github.com/roscoelabs/beams/wiki/Getting-Started">guide</a> on GitHub covering step-by-step installation of Beams, to get your project up and running quickly.</p>
<p>As ever, we welcome contributions from the community to improve Beams, which is free to use under MIT license. The best ways to participate are via either <a href="//github.com/roscoelabs">GitHub</a> or the Beams Working Group <a href="//groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/beams-working-group">email list</a>, which is open to anyone who wants to contribute to the project, regardless of technical background.</p>
